I am a PhD student in the Department of Computational & Data Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore. Prior to this, I have worked as a Data Scientist in IBM India Pvt. Ltd after completing my Masters in Computer Science & Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.

During my stay in IBM, I have worked on a question answering project which would read a corpus, accept questions from the user on the corpus, and output point answers. I have also worked on other NLP projects in my leisure hours, like sentiment classification.

As a novice PhD student working with [Prof. Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/), I am presently learning the basics of Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Computer Vision and hope to make significant contributions to the same. I am associated with the wonderful group of people (and researchers) at [VAL Lab](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/).

Academics takes up most of time. However, listening to the music of the good old days (especially Hindi and Bengali music of 50s to 90s 
) is one of my favourite past times.
